# Project 1: What factors have contributed to the spread of COVID-19 in different regions of the world

## Factors:
- Climate: How has the difference in climate across different countries, contributed to the spread of COVID-19?
- Government Response: How has the difference in government response contributed to the spread of COVID-19?
- Vaccination Rate: Has a higher proportion of vaccinated people lead to lower rates of severe illness and death with regards to COVID-19?
- Air pollution rate: Did areas with poor air quality have higher rates of COVID-19 transmission?
