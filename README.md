# The influence of various factors on the spread of COVID-19

The aim of this assignment was to examine the influence of various factors on the spread of COVID-19, and to determine if any regional discrepancies existed. 

The factors that we have considered are the following:
1. Climate: 
  1.1 Countries with higher average temperatures exhibit increased numbers of COVID-19 cases
  1.2 Countries with higher levels of humidity exhibit increased numbers of COVID-19 cases?
2. Government Response: Longer periods of closed: schools, workplaces and international travel lead to a lower spread of COVID-19 cases?
3. Vaccination Rate:
  3.1 Higher vaccination rates result in a lower reproduction rate
  3.2 Higher vaccination rates result in a lower death rate
4. Air quality: Areas with poor air quality have shown higher rates of COVID-19 cases.
