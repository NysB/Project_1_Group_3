# The influence of various factors on the spread of COVID-19

## Introduction:

The aim of this assignment was to examine the influence of various factors on the spread of COVID-19, and to determine if any regional discrepancies existed. 

The factors that we have considered are the following:
1. Government Response: Extended periods of school- and workplace closing, and international travel restrictions, have lead to a lower spread of COVID-19 cases.
2. Vaccination Rate: Higher vaccination rates result in lower reproduction rates and lower death rates.   
3. Air quality: Areas with poor air quality have shown higher rates of COVID-19 cases.

## Data:

For our analysis, we have used the following datasets. These can also be found in folder "Dataset":
